# Founders & Coders

We are a self-funded social enterprise run by its membership as a freelance co-operative. The membership is made up of our students and alumni, our two directors, Dan and Ines, and our resident mentor-in-chief, Nelson. 

According to documents lodged at *Companies House*, 

    The companyâ€™s activities will provide benefit to our members, 
    to students of our study programmes, and to the wider public

And our activities include:

    Providing programmes of study for the general public.

    Providing a place of learning and work for our members.

And,

    If the company makes any surplus it will be used for developing further 
    programmes of study and for developing further places of study and work.

That's it.
